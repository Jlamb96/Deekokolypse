A Roguelike Survival Apocalypse game where you must rebuild your car within 14 day. 

Programmed 100% in Python. Over 1200 lines. All written by me Jeremy Lamb

You start off with no resources besides a random amount of cash and must use it to purchase from the trader which also has random supplies and restocks and must 
also scavenge for supplies to build your car and protect yourself from the dangers of the post-apocalyptic world. I plan on making this more and more random each 
playthrough with more events, price variations, and many more things.


The game features a range of challenges and obstacles to overcome, including scavenging for resources, fighting off raiders, and managing your time and resources
effectively. It's a fun and challenging game that will keep you on your toes!
